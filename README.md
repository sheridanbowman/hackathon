A mix-up of retro classics Metal Slug and Dig Dug! Dig down with your tank and avoid the ghosts! 

Collect gems to score points, chests for a chance at extra lives- all while more monsters swarm you as you dig deeper!

Features: sprite animation, gravity and collision 'physics', procedural generation of chunks with incrementing difficulty, and more! (a lot of bugs)
